# GradeScope Calendar (Modified)
Forked from: [calvinatian/gradescope-calendar](https://github.com/calvinatian/gradescope-calendar)

### Few Changes for myself
- Manual Addition of Class IDs (Some Professors don't remove their classes asap)
- Manual Addition of Google Calendar IDs 
- Few More Loggings for better debugging 
- OS Environment Variable Usages (Not really a change)

### Reminder
- Check Modified Parts of Library as mentioned in `index.py`
- My coding style in Python is :shit:, so don't expect good readability 
- Let's not miss any homeworks on gradescope :smile: 
- It was designed to be used in Linux (Debian) with crontab
